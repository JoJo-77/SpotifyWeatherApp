# Spotify Weather App
## Weather Backend:
- Libraries:
  + Beautiful Soup 4
    - MAC OSX/LINUX: ```pip install beautifulsoup4```
    - WINDOWS: TODO
- Usage:
  + ``` python3 parse.py```
  + Enter a zipcode
  + Location, Weather Description, and Temperature in F and C will be displayed
- Notes: 
  + Still needs to be integrated with other parts of website. So far all that this does is take in user input and print to a terminal without saving any data.
