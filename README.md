- Requirements:

  - Libraries:
    + Beautiful Soup 4
      - MAC OSX/LINUX: ```pip install beautifulsoup4```
      - WINDOWS: Dual boot and see above
- Usage:
  + ``` python3 parse.py```
  + Enter a zipcode
  + Location, Weather Description, and Temperature in F and C will be displayed
- Notes: 
  + Still needs to be integrated with other parts of website. So far all that this does is take in user input and print to a terminal without saving any data.
